* dependencies

  apt-get install python python-ipaddr python-twisted

* why are errors getting eaten all the time?

   for example, just recently I upgraded twisted and/or didn't correctly
   have a doStart and doStop on my Factory -- but the whole mess just sat
   there and when I hit ctl-c I you finally see the correct (?) stack
   trace.

   answer --> all Deferreds need an errback added to them, as per
   itamer and ivan on #twisted

* ns/all returns stuff like it says here:
