-------------------

For novelty value, the Web site (with built documentation and so forth)
can be viewed via Tor at http://timaq4ygg2iegci7.onion although the
code itself is hosted via git::

    torsocks git clone git://timaq4ygg2iegci7.onion/txtorcon.git

or::

    git clone git://github.com/meejah/txtorcon.git

You may contact me via ``meejah at meejah dot ca`` with GPG key
`0xC2602803128069A7
<http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xC2602803128069A7>`_
or see ``meejah.asc`` in the repository. The fingerprint is ``9D5A
2BD5 688E CB88 9DEB CD3F C260 2803 1280 69A7``.

It is often possible to contact me as ``meejah`` in #tor-dev on `OFTC
<http://www.oftc.net/oftc/>`_ but be patient for replies (I do look at
scrollback, so putting "meejah: " in front will alert my client).

More conventionally, you may get the code at GitHub and documentation
via ReadTheDocs:

-  https://github.com/meejah/txtorcon
-  https://txtorcon.readthedocs.org

Please do **use the GitHub issue-tracker** to report bugs. Patches,
pull-requests, comments and criticisms are all welcomed and
appreciated.
